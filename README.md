# TravellingSalesman
 
The Travelling Salesman is a problem of finding the shortest distance between a given number of destinations. It's classified as an NP-hard problem.

This projects randomly generates a set of node destinations (based off user input), then provides the solution for the quickest route and displays it to the user.

A couple of points for future improvement:

1. Additional algorithms could be added. At the moment it just solves the problem via brute force.
2. The code could be better segregated/cleaned up.
3. The project could be rewritten without turtle which would signigicantly improve the UI performance.
